I belive the best way to learn data-science is by doing. In this blog I share my learning experiences in the topics of Causal-Inference and general ML through simulation studies and hands on experimentation.

Posts in this blog are graciously hosted also on the [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) blog.

This blog structure and layout are based on the "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package.
